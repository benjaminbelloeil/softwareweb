## 🛡️ Database Setup and Network Security

### Setting Up Vercel Database
1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and create a new **Vercel Database**.
2. Configure your schema and create the required tables.
3. Add the `DATABASE_URL` provided by Vercel Database to your environment variables.

### Querying the Database
Here’s an example query:
```javascript
import { db } from '@vercel/database';

const getData = async () => {
  const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM tasks');
  return result.rows;
};
```

### Network Security Measures 🛡️
To ensure the safety and privacy of user data, SoftwareWeb implements the following:
- **HTTPS Encryption:** All data transferred is encrypted.
- **Secure Cookies:** Authentication cookies are `HttpOnly` and `Secure`.
- **Environment Variables:** Sensitive information is stored in `.env` and never exposed.
- **Regular Security Audits:** Dependencies are updated to avoid vulnerabilities.

## 🌟 Database Features
- **Serverless and Scalable:** Automatically scales with demand.
- **Low Latency:** Optimized for fast queries.
- **Seamless Integration:** Works natively with Vercel and Next.js.
